# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website. It displays links to different avatars and a gallery of photos.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the website.
*   `main.js`: The JavaScript file for the website.

## Plan: Full Redesign (New)

1.  **Modern & Responsive HTML Structure:** Create a new `index.html` with a semantic and easy-to-understand structure, including a header, a navigation section for your links, and a main content area for your gallery.
2.  **New `style.css`:** Write completely new CSS to create a beautiful, modern design. This will include:
    *   A clean, dark-themed color palette.
    *   Responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid that look great on desktop and mobile.
    *   A well-organized grid for your photo gallery.
    *   Modern typography and hover effects for interactivity.
3.  **Simplified `main.js`:** Start with a clean JavaScript file, ready for any future interactive features you might want.
